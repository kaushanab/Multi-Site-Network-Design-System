# Multi-Site Network Design & Configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **design and implementation of a three-site interconnected network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The network is built to ensure **reliability, scalability, and secure communication** between geographically separated locations.

The project simulates a real-world enterprise network where multiple branches communicate efficiently using proper IP addressing, routing, and basic security practices.

---

## 🏗️ Network Architecture

* **Number of Sites:** 3 (Site A, Site B, Site C)
* **Topology:** Multi-site enterprise network
* **Interconnection:** Routers connecting each site
* **End Devices:** PCs, switches, and servers (if applicable)

Each site operates as an independent local network while maintaining seamless communication with other sites.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

* Static routing between all three networks
* Logical IP addressing and subnetting
* Inter-site communication verification using ICMP (ping)
* Scalable design allowing easy addition of new sites
* Improved reliability through structured network layout
* Secure and organized traffic flow between locations

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools Used

* **Cisco Packet Tracer**
* Cisco Routers & Switches
* Static Routing
* IPv4 Addressing & Subnetting
